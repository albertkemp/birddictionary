         <p>The Xantus's Hummingbird is a mid-sized hummingbird. It's back is mostly emerald green, it has buff undersides and a rufous tail. They have a dark face with a bold white stripe over the top of the eye to the back of the head. The male's forehead is darker than the female's.
            It has a red beak with a black tip and browny wings with some moss green fluff just lining the patch of skin under the emerald and above the buff. <br><br> It feeds mainly on <strong>nectar from flowers and flowering trees using a long extendable tongue or catches insects on the wing</strong>. Its unusual name comes from the Hungarian zoologist, John Xantus de Vesey (Xantus János).
