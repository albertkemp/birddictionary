    <p>These huge coots weigh <strong>between 2.3 – 3.8 kg</strong>. They have strong red legs and a large stout red beak. Their feathers range from a dark royal blue head, neck and breast, to peacock blue shoulders, through to shades of iridescent turquoise and olive green on their wings and back. They feed on mainly the <strong>starchy leaf bases of tussock and sedge species, and also tussock seeds when available</strong>. If there is a heavy snow cover they will move to the forest and feed mainly on the underground rhizomes of the summer green fern.</p>
