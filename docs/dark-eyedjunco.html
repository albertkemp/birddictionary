    <p>The Dark-eyed Junco is a species of junco which are a family of small grayish New World Sparrows. They are common across most of temperate North America and in summer they range
        north as high as the Arctic. The Dark-eyed Junco is a very variable species, quite like the related Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca) and it's systematics are still not completely found out.
