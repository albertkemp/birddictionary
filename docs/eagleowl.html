    <p>Eagle owls (or bubos) live throughout Europe and Asia. They have an extremely large wingspan, and they are well-known for <strong>bright orange eyes and tufts of feathers on their heads</strong>. They are birds of prey and while they can live in many different habitats, they often build nests in rocky areas.</p>
