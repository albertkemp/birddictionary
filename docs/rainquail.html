    <p>The Rain Quail lacks barring on primaries. The <strong>male has a black breast-patch and distinctive head pattern of black and white</strong>. The female is difficult to distinguish from female common and Japanese Quail, although the spots on the breast are more delicate. They eat mainly the <strong>seeds of grasses and other plants, insect larvae and small invertebrates.</strong></p>
